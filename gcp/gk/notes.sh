You have multiple issues happening at once:

ArgoCD App Sync Failing (Dry Run Issue)
This suggests that some Kubernetes resources cannot be applied because of constraints, validation errors, or conflicts.

Stuck Deletion of the ArgoCD App
The App is stuck in a "deleting" state, likely due to Kubernetes finalizers preventing its removal.

Step 1: Identify the Failing Objects
To check which objects failed to apply, run:

kubectl -n <namespace> get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp | tail -n 20
You can also get ArgoCD logs for more details:

kubectl -n argocd logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server --tail=50
Or check the application status in JSON format:

kubectl -n argocd get application <app-name> -o json | jq '.status.conditions'
If Gatekeeper constraints are the issue, you'll likely see messages referencing ConstraintTemplate violations.

Step 2: Identify and Remove Blocking Gatekeeper Constraints
To list all Gatekeeper constraints:

kubectl get constraints --all-namespaces
To see the specific constraints affecting your resources:

kubectl get constraints -o yaml | grep "enforcementAction"
If you find a problematic constraint, you can delete it:

kubectl delete <constraint-kind> <constraint-name>
Example:

kubectl delete K8sRequiredLabels my-label-constraint
If constraints are defined as part of an ArgoCD App, you may need to remove them from Git first, then allow ArgoCD to reconcile.

Step 3: Force-Delete Stuck ArgoCD App
Since you tried removing the Argo App, but itâ€™s stuck due to finalizers, you need to manually remove the finalizer.

Check the finalizers on the stuck ArgoCD App:

kubectl get application <app-name> -n argocd -o json | jq '.metadata.finalizers'
Remove the finalizers:

kubectl patch application <app-name> -n argocd --type=json -p '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/finalizers"}]'
If you get an error saying the object is already marked for deletion, do this:

kubectl edit application <app-name> -n argocd
Remove the finalizers section manually.
Save and exit.
Verify deletion:

kubectl get application <app-name> -n argocd
If the App is still stuck, force delete it:

kubectl delete application <app-name> -n argocd --force --grace-period=0
Step 4: Clean Up Stuck Resources
If the App removal is still blocked, look for any resources stuck in "Terminating":

kubectl get all -A | grep Terminating
For each stuck resource:

kubectl patch <resource-type> <resource-name> -n <namespace> --type=json -p '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/finalizers"}]'
Example:

kubectl patch constrainttemplate my-template -n gatekeeper-system --type=json -p '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/finalizers"}]'
If you have multiple stuck constraints, you can remove all their finalizers:

for ct in $(kubectl get constrainttemplates -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.name}"); do
    kubectl patch constrainttemplate $ct --type=json -p '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/finalizers"}]'
done
After this, try deleting the stuck resources again.

Final Steps
Once everything is cleaned up:

Recreate the Argo App if needed.
Ensure Gatekeeper constraints are correctly applied.
Retry syncing your application.
