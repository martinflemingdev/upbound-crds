i have martin.mf65@gmail.com representing the "platform" 
I have martinflemingdev@gmail.com representing the "consumer"

at first, the consumer cannot see the project at all in the GCP Console

they need roles/viewer or perhaps a custom role that gives the bare minimum of 

# resourcemanager.projects.get → Allows user to see the project in GCP.
# resourcemanager.projects.list → Allows user to list projects they have access to.
# iam.serviceAccounts.list → Allows user to see service accounts.

after that, they need a ServiceAccountIAMMember binding with role: "roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin" for their user:email and the serviceAccountID

this should be elevated and time bound
